# biopharm_catalyst_project
*the goal of this project is to determine how biotech hedge fund form 13s can inform probalistic catalyst event outcomes*

## Results
The primary findings of the analysis was a significant statistical increase in positive event outcome occurence in tickers drawn from biotech hedge fund form 13s when compared to a baseline. The negative alpha attributed to negative outcome events was also less compared to the baseline. These findings support the hypothesis that biotech fund 13s can aid in determining the likely event outcome for specific catalysts.
